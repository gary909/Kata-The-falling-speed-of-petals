    <title>The falling speed of petals</title>

    <p>
        When it's spring Japanese cherries blossom, it's called "sakura" and it's admired a lot. The petals start to fall in late April.<br>
<br>
        Suppose that the falling speed of a petal is 5 centimeters per second (5 cm/s), and it takes 80 seconds for the petal to reach <br>
        the ground from a certain branch.<br>
<br>
        Write a function that receives the speed (in cm/s) of a petal as input, and returns the time it takes for that petal to reach <br>
        the ground from the same branch.<br>
<br>
        Notes:<br>
<br>
        The movement of the petal is quite complicated, so in this case we can see the velocity as a constant during its falling.<br>
        Pay attention to the data types.<br>
        If the initial velocity is non-positive, the return value should be 0<br>
